# HMM Baum-Welch Implementation

## Student Information
* **Name:** A K ASIF
* **Registration Number:** TCR24CS007
* **University:** APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using the **Baum-Welch algorithm**. This is a type of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm used for finding the unknown parameters of an HMM.



## Visual Implementation
The code is visually implemented using a live dashboard. You can interact with the model and see the state transition diagrams here:

## How the Algorithm Works
1. **E-Step (Expectation):** Calculates the probability of being in each hidden state using the Forward-Backward algorithm.
2. **M-Step (Maximization):** Updates the transition and emission matrices to better fit the observed sequence.
